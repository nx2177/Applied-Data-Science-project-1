The final code, original dataset, and final cleaned dataset are contained in the "Final_Data_Code" folder. The "Intermediary_Data_Code" contains a lot of files that we had used as intermediary steps as our members were getting used to Github and using different softwares -- they are only there to show the steps taken in between putting the final folder together. 
Within "Final_Data_Code" we have the following files:
Datasets:
1. Original dataset: SupplyChainGHGEmissionFactors_v1.3.0_NAICS_CO2e_USD2022.csv
2. messed dataset: extremely_messy_data_v3.csv
3. cleaned dataset: cleaned_data_vf.csv
Code Files:
1. mess.R: we used this code to export messed data.
2. Integrated_final.ipynb: Full code for data cleaning, EDA, and feature engineering.
